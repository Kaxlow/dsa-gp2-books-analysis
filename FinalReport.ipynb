The stopwords come from the nltk dictionary of common stopwords like \"the\", \"and\", \"is\". The string is then converted to tokens, giving a list of words separated by whitespace. \n",

The class *TextAnalysis()* is initialized with the full string output given by the preprocessing module. Each function can return both a visualization and a table. These can be changed by setting the parameters *graph* and *table* to False. Both of these parameters are found in every function. \n",

The most common three-word phrase is *copyright george allen*, which occurs twice as much as the next most common three-word phrase.
